# Wordle

In this assignment, you will create a Wordle game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To get a feeling of how it works, watch a recording of the game on D2L attached to the assignment. Also, make sure you read the [Notes](#page_with_curl-notes) at the end of this page.

---

## :foot: Steps
- Add your HTML code to the [index.html](./wordle/index.html) file
- Add your CSS code to the [style.css](./wordle/style.css) file
- Add your JavaScript code to the [wordle.js](./wordle/wordle.js) file
- Push your changes to the remote `main` branch

---

## :page_with_curl: Notes
- The page reads a dictionary of words from this endpoint: `https://api.masoudkf.com/v1/wordle`. The endpoint requires an API key (`sw0Tr2othT1AyTQtNDUE06LqMckbTiKWaVYhuirv`). You can use `fetch` and add the key like the following:
    ```js
    const res = await fetch("https://api.masoudkf.com/v1/wordle", {
        headers: {
        "x-api-key": "sw0Tr2othT1AyTQtNDUE06LqMckbTiKWaVYhuirv",
        },
    });
  ```
- Here's a sample response of what the endpoint returns. It returns a `JSON` object. You don't need to be concerned about the `statusCode` property; what you want is `dictionary`:

    ```json
    {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "dictionary": [
        {
            "word": "Pain",
            "hint": "Attending any class other than ENSF 381 gives you ____"
        },
        {
            "word": "Nerd",
            "hint": "You may be considered one, if you like Star Trek"
        }
        ]
    }
    ```
- Unlike the original Wordle game, you don't need to check if the word exists in the dictionary
- You only read from the endpoint **once** per page refresh. Hitting the `Start Over` button shouldn't send another request if the user hasn't refreshed the page. It only picks a random new word from the already-loaded dictionary. You can generate a random number between 0 and N using the following code:
    ```javascript
    Number.parseInt(Math.random() * N)
    ```
- The `Start Over` button should become `disabled` while the code is getting the dictionary from the endpoint for the first time, and say `Loading...`
- You need to capture key events from the user and populate the boxes. The key event used in the demo is `keyup`, and the boxes are marked up using the `table` element. But feel free to change that
- Users can use the `Backspace` key to remove characters from the word 
- Users must use the `Enter` key to submit an answer. On Mac OS, the key is called `Return`, but the key code is the same
- If a user hits the `Enter` key while the word is not complete, the page should alert the user to finish the word first. You can use `window.alert("first complete the word")` for this
- After a word submission:
    - Letters in the right spot should get a green background
    - Letters in the word but in the wrong spot should get a yellowish background
    - Letters not in the word should get a gray background 
- At any time in the game, users can use the `?` icon on the menu to see a hint about the word. This hint is part of the dictionary returned from the endpoint
- When a user wins, the page should show a congratulation image. You can find the one used in the demo [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1675467141/ENSF-381/labs/congrats_fkscna.gif)
- When a user loses, they should get a message with a red background saying they couldn't guess the word and lost
- The `i` icon in the menu shows the game instructions
- The Moon icon in the menu can toggle the page from Light to Dark theme
- I didn't use any CSS framework for the layout, but feel free to use one if you want
- The icons on the menu are HTML characters (`&#9681;` for the Dark Mode icon; `&#63;` for the Hint icon; and `&#9432;` for the Game Instructions icon)
- You're only allowed to use vanilla JavaScript (JavaScript without any external libraries, such as React) for this assignment
